# MozFest2017 - Quick Reaction game

Within this repository you will find code and tutorial files for a quick reaction game coded in EduBlocks. Edublocks is designed to make the transition between Scratch and Python easier. 

This is a session which I am running within the Youth Zone at MozFest 2017.
