# Presentation Notes

## Slide 1 - Intro

* Who I am

* What is EduBlocks

## Slide 2 - Quick Reaction Game

* What is the Quick Reaction Game

* What you should have infront of you.

## Slide 3 - Breadboard

* Temporary prototying device

* Components attach by insrting the leads into the holes on the breadboard.

* Has Strips of Wires inside to connct the holes as shown in Image 2.

## Slide 4 - LED

* Light Emitting Diode is a semiconductor device that lights up when an electric current is passes through it.

* Cathode (-) is the shorter leg of the LED, it is also marked with a flat edge on the plastic.

* Annode (+) is the longer leg of your LED on this diagram it is the leg that is bent.

## Sldie 5 - Resistor

* Resistors are fairly boring, but useful.

* on their own they don't do anything bar get a little warm

* In a circuit like ours they stop too much electric current passing through the LED.

* if the LED gets too much current it can go pop.

## Slide 6 - Button

* We have 2 of these in out Circuit.

* when the buttomn is pressed the circuit is completed as soon as it is released the curcuit is broken.
